HMs are a genuinely brilliant design choice. Most JRPGs have a very
clear line between exploration and combat, and this was especially
true at the time Pokémon was originally released. But Pokémon was
serious about adding some fun exploration elements to the overworld.
It's kind of like a minimal version of a Metroid or Zelda game in that
respect. Like those games, you explore the world, you get tools that
let you interact with the world in new ways, and then you explore even
more. It's fun!

The very clever thing is that, through HMs, you teach _your Pokémon_
the skills that allow you to explore the world, rather than learning
them yourself. And the skills are combat abilities, so your
exploration tools interact with combat. It emphasizes that your
Pokémon are more than just things you send out to battle -- they're
companions that explore the world together with you. What a nice idea!

Mechanically, this also plays to Pokémon's strengths. The games are
often excellent at getting the player to consider making changes to
their party. HMs play into that, because not every Pokémon can learn
every HM. It's easy to go through half the game without having a
Flying type Pokémon on your team without even noticing it -- but as
soon as you get the extremely useful Fly HM, it becomes very
attractive to give some flier a permanent spot in your party.

That's why everyone loves HMs, and they remain a staple of the Pokémon
games to this day.

Just kidding! HMs caused some serious problems, and fans' complaints
about HMs grew steadily louder over time. By looking at how HMs
changed over time, it's evident that Game Freak either capitulated to
or agreed with the fans. At first, new HMs were being added every
generation, but the compounding problems had clearly reached a
critical point sometime before the release of Generation V (_Pokémon
Black_ and _White_). Gen V was not only the first generation to _not
add_ a new HM, it was also the first generation _remove_ an HM without
replacing it with another -- and it removed _two_! Generation VI
(_Pokémon X_ and _Y_) was the last generation to feature HMs at all.

We're now up to Generation IX, and HMs have been a thing of the past
for three whole generations. If HMs have been non-existent for fully a
third of the Pokémon franchise's life, could it be that they were
never any good to begin with?

To answer that, let's start by summarizing the major problems of HMs:

**HMs take up move slots.** As I mentioned before, HMs take up a slot
of your Pokémon's combat moves. But, with only four slots available
for each Pokémon, you don't have many to spare. A full team of 6
Pokémon has only 24 total move slots, and HMs eat into that.

**HMs are hard to unlearn.** Further, unlike every other move, HM
moves cannot be replaced by a new move move your Pokémon learns. This
is a necessary evil to prevent a player from getting stuck by entering
an area using an HM move, unlearning that move, and then being unable
to get back. HM moves can only be removed at a specific location in
each game.

**Most HMs are terrible as combat moves.** Here are all the HMs ever
made:
1. Cut
2. Fly
3. Surf
4. Strength
5. Flash
6. Whirlpool
7. Waterfall
8. Rock Smash
9. Defog
10. Rock Climb

_Most of these moves were terrible when they were introduced._ There
are some exceptions -- Surf is a great water move, even to this day.
Fly was great in the early generations. Waterfall was a worse version
of Surf when it was introduced[^1] but got buffed in Generation IV
(_Pokémon Diamond_ and _Pearl_). _Every other HM is a bad combat
option in its respective game, even at the point in the game you get
it._

[^1]: I just learned while writing this that Waterfall, while
    introduced as an HM in Gen II, was actually already a move in Gen
    I! It was the signature move of the Goldeen evolutionary line. Who
    knew! Well, people who had a Goldeen in their party knew, I guess.

---

Note that each of these problems compound on each other. If HMs take
up a smaller share of move slots, it's not as big a deal if they're
bad in combat, because you don't give up as much to keep them around.
If HMs are easy to unlearn, it's not a big deal if they take up a move
slot -- you can easily replace that slot with a better move later. So
fixing or minimizing even one of these problems lessens all the issues
HMs have. So, did these problems get worse over time, or were they
always bad?

Let's start with the easy one: HMs were hardest to unlearn in
Generation I (_Pokémon Red_ and _Blue_), because it is the only
generation in which you simply couldn't unlearn HM moves. Score one
for HMs getting better over time. But, even in generations with Move
Deleters, the Move Deleters are always found late in the game. At
best, you have to wait until badge #6 to unlearn an HM. So, even
generations that mitigate this problem still force you to commit to
any taught HMs for the majority of the game. This specific problem got
better over time, not worse -- but it didn't get dramatically better.

What about the burden of move slots? Gen I had 5 total HMs. To have
all HMs available at all times (which is not actually necessary), you
would need to tie up 5 out of 24, or a little over one-fifth, of your
total available move slots. But by Gen IV , there were **8** HMs,
requiring **a full third of your party's combat slots!** So this
definitely got worse, and surely played a part in the decision to
reduce the number of HMs in Gen V.

As for the relative power of HMs, this is where things get a little
more interesting. Let's start by taking a look at Gen I's HMs, where
this problem was the least bad. We have:
1. Cut
2. Fly
3. Surf
4. Strength
5. Flash

2 of these (Surf and Fly) are contenders for best moves of their
respective type. The other 3 are bad options even by the time you get
them. _Future generations had a worse ratio than this._ This is as
good as it gets!

But there's more to it than that. This problem is the least bad in Gen
I for more reasons than just the ratio of good HM moves to bad ones.
The other mitigating factor is that _Gen I move slots were less
valuable, because there were fewer good moves._

Say, for example, you want to use Flash to get through Rock Tunnel.
You're gonna have to sacrifice a move slot for a basically worthless
move. But what Pokémon can afford to have only _three_ move slots for
the rest of the game? Well, basically everyone. Let's look at
Pikachu's learn set, for example:

![Pikachu's Unimpressive Learnset](/assets/pikachu_rb_learnset.png#small)

At the end of this little guy's career, he will have:
1. An electric attacking move (Thunder Bolt by TM or Thunder
   otherwise)
2. Thunder Wave
3. A Normal type attacking move (either Quick Attack or Swift, or
   something from a TM)
4. Uh.... Agility, even though you're already fast? Growl??

It's hard to find a good use for that fourth move slot. That means the
_opportunity cost_ of sealing one slot away forever with basically an
empty space is quite low.

It may seem unfair to pick an Electric type, since they have famously
shallow move pools. Okay, let's pick something more charitable, then.
How about Charizard[^2]?

[^2]: Please note that, while I knew Pikachu's move pool was very
    shallow before I started writing this, I didn't cherry pick
    Charizard -- I didn't even know his Gen I move pool before I
    started writing this. I just thought, "Who's likely to have a deep
    move pool in Gen I?" and looked up whoever I thought of. I was
    honestly surprised to only see two types in all of Charizard's
    level up learn set, but I shouldn't have been. _This is just what
    Gen I move pools look like._

![Charizard's Red and Blue
Learnset](/assets/charizard_rb_learnset.png#small)

Throughout all of Charizard's life, it will essentially learn two
varieties of move: Normal type attacking moves, and Fire type
attacking moves. You need to dip into TMs to have any use at all for
half of Charizard's move slots! Adding in TM options still only gives
us a few more viable choices for our beloved starter, bringing the
total number of useful moves by endgame to around 8. But TMs distort
our number of options a bit -- since most TMs cannot be replenished,
any TM we use on Charizard is one we can't use anywhere else. So if
there are, say, a total of 10 good TMs, they can't use up more than 10
of our 24 slots -- the other 14 options have to come from each
individual Pokémon's level up learn set.

Now, 8 options is still more than 4, so it's definitely possible to
fill out all four move slots! But in company like this, we're not
exactly missing out on much if we use a slot on Strength. Frankly, if
we naively threw Cut onto Charmeleon in the early game, it wouldn't be
that great of a loss. We just don't have that many ways to get all 4
move slots to put in work for us, so throwing one away on even 5 of
your 6 Pokémon is just not that great a cost.

This is in stark contrast to future generations. For example, here's
Charizard's Diamond and Pearl learn set:

![Charzard's Diamond and Pearl
Learnset](/assets/charizard_dp_learnset.png#small)

Charizard learns attacking moves from 5 different types[^4]. You'll
have to choose one type you don't want to have coverage for, because
you only have four move slots! In an environment where each move slot
has so many good options, even 5 HMs would have felt burdensome. But
_8_ HMs? That feels downright oppressive!

As the generations went on, _Pokémon_ combat got better and better.
Part of the reason for this is that there are many more moves, and
many more _good_ moves. By as early as Gen IV, not only was it easy to
fill out all 4 of any given Pokémon's move slots, it was consistently
difficult to choose which moves to keep!

[^4]: Including Flying! Charizard, the Fire/Flying type, didn't have a
    Flying type move at all in Gen 1 -- He couldn't even learn Fly!

So, of the three problems we outlined, two were much less significant
in Gen I, and the remaining one was only slightly better in future
generations. It's pretty conclusive that, although HMs always suffered
from the same problems, HMs were much less problematic when they were
introduced than when they were removed.

---

Were HMs better in earlier generations? Yes. But they were better
_because the combat was worse._ Pokémon had fewer moves that were
worth using. As the gameplay developed, the combat became more
interesting, and part of that was developing more moves that
interacted with each other in novel ways. While Game Freak didn't do
themselves any favors by making most HMs so bad in combat[^3], the
competition for move slots got more and more fierce over the
generations. As such, bad HM moves hurt more and more, until the
combat was so good that we couldn't afford to have HMs in the game
anymore!

HMs should be remembered as the good idea they were, but one which the
series eventually grew past. Because the types of problems HMs posed
were always the same, it's easy to misremember those problems as
always being equally severe. In fact, HMs were a great idea, and they
were implemented well in the context of the first game. It's good HMs
are gone, but that doesn't mean they were a mistake to begin with.

[^3]: I suspect they feared players would teach good HMs to everyone
    on the team, making each Pokémon feel too similar to one another
    in combat. Still, I'm not sure making most HMs so bad was the best
    way to avoid that.
