I have a troubling habit that I've recently been trying to reign in. When a thought occurs to me, either an opinion or a worry, I'll Google the whole though, more or less verbatim. Unlike in the 90s or early 2000s, the internet is huge now, so I almost always find someone who shares the same thought.


Spending a lot of time reading other people's opinions, either by searching them out or scrolling on social media a lot, has made it difficult to feel confident in my own opinion. It's like fact-finding, but for opinions: if there's nothing on the internet to corroborate a basic fact (like, "are all Canadian people left-handed?"), it's probably nonsense -- at best, there's likely no evidence for it. Taking that outlook to opinions is a natural next step, but is insidious self-sabotage. It yields your own perspective to the whims of others.

This may fuel so-called "discourse" -- it feels like seeing people online talking both to and past each other gives a complete picture of all the opinions that reasonable people can discuss. But this is, of course, ridiculous! Most conversations between most people aren't happing over the internet. It just feels that way because the internet is so bottomlessly vast.
